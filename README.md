# Telling, by BA Colley

## The back story to the book

My mother, Bee-Ann Colley, made three prints of her book, "Telling", which she gave away within the family.

This is a project to get the book online.

There is an epub document published on the Apple bookstore, and an web version, published at <https://musings.thruhere.net/telling>.
