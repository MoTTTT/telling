  <p>Private nursing was fun as you could do a case or two and then hare around the country seeing places, and when you ran out of money do it all over again. Sometimes if we had easy cases we would meet at the Serpentine in Hyde Park, eat some breakfast at the caf√© there, and swim and go to sleep under a tree until time to go back to work, eat again and off we would go. Also there is the attraction of looking after only one person which means that you can really do it properly. Both Lamorna and I had some interesting cases. All this fun and games beat hollow the idea of going to Perth and becoming a student again so we never did! With private nursing you lose out on practising to run a ward, but because only the very difficult or unusual cases had 'specials' which was the, then, equivalent of the intensive care units of today, you learned quite a lot of unusual stuff.</p>

  <p>I nursed in a Jewish house or two. In one family the lady had something to do with picture houses, and would give me her vouchers so Lamorna and I saw film previews aplenty. In another house I informed the family that my patient the Matriarch was by far too sick to preside over the Friday night session that week. Next thing I knew her sons were talking about how much they had paid for a consignment of sardines and that revived her, she just about hit the roof and was shocked into comparative health for another week or two.</p>

  <p>The Jewish patients were quite able to integrate a nurse into their households but this seemed difficult for other families. Sometimes one was put into the kitchens with the largely foul-mouthed servants, or sat at the family table where the conversation was of the South of France, yachts, race horses and the like; some simply put a table outside for nurses - by far the best.</p>

  <p>Once or twice Doc and my mum came to London to stay with me for a holiday.</p>

  <p>I had a Swiss patient, Victor, with head injuries who when he came back to see his specialist a few months later took me out a couple of times, I never really liked him though. I also got to know a male nurse quite well - can not have been that well as I can't remember his name now. Lamorna had an Indian friend for a while. Mrs Nash, when I visited them - fancying me as a daughter-in-law - would do her best to get her oldest son Michael and I off somewhere, but it never really worked. We did, however, dutifully go to a few places together, notably 'My Fair Lady'. Michael had a motorbike and I quite liked the motorbike.</p>

  <p>Then Lamorna took herself off to France to do an au pair job teaching a little 'un to speak English. By this time I was almost a permanent fixture at the London Clinic specialising cases there. There was Amin, and his interpreter Jimmy. These two were Arab, pure Arab. They looked the part, hooked noses and brownish skins. Old Amin was a hajji, and wore the white and black headscarf with the black circlet that I had to put back on after I had washed him. I was always scared that I would put the thing back wrong and create an international incident! Amin, who was, as I saw him, a lovely, lovely old gentleman, learned a little cockney English. He would walk the Clinic corridors with my help and to each soul that he passed he would say 'Salaam Ali Cum', and nearly topple over in his depth of bow. Then to make sure that they knew they were being greeted he would add 'allow 'allow 'allow'.</p>

  <p>The only previous knowledge I had of Arabs was from P C Wren's books and Rudolph Valantino prancing around with a white scarf draped around his head and some daft woman singing "oh Shiek of Arabeee, your love belongs to meeee." So I found Ali, his cousin, and Jimmy, Mahamoud was his correct name, quite fascinating. I went out with Jimmy a couple of times I think largely so that I could tell my mum I had been out with a genuine Arab. No wonder she was scared to ask what colour the South African was when Dad arrived on the scene! I don't think Jimmy was a very good example of traditional Arab anyway, I had always thought that they were 'hot' stuff with horses. One time when I came back from Devon after a weekend or something I had a mark on my arm where a horse had bitten me, and when asked what the mark was, told him, whereupon an argument ensued because Mahamoud insisted that horses did not bite. Amin was brought in to quell the riot and said "ridiculous, of course horses bite," or words to that effect.</p>

  <p>Amin turned out to be inoperable, and his cousin was in quite a stew about it all because he had told the family that they could do anything in England. If they would only let them take his uncle there they would cure him. He was quite scared to go home, poor man.</p>

  <p>After nursing Miss McQuade at the Clinic I went home with her and became a permanent fixture in her household for a while. She was 84 and also inoperable. She was great fun to be with and took me all over the place with her. Convinced that she would be well enough she planned a last trip back to her native Australia where I was to go with her, she was however never well enough. But in the interim she learned that I could not dance and dancing, it seemed, was a must if you are to travel any distance by boat, so she advised me to go and learn to dance. I endeavoured to do this by signing up at the London Dance Institute in Oxford Street. Sadly I was not too good at dancing in the same way that I was not too good on a bicycle. To do with a somewhat impaired sense of balance. Anyway I had paid my money, and so they gamely tried to teach me to dance. They even set one of their bright students at the task, and that was Dad (hitherto referred to as Andrew). Finding ourselves badly in need of some coffee after these sessions we went out to have that together. Funny thing about Andrew, apart from Martin he is the only man in whose company I feel entirely comfortable. There are a few men of our acquaintance now that I have gotten pretty used to however. This business about feeling comfortable with Andrew has always struck me as odd because from the very beginning he was at times irritable, bad tempered, or depressed, or all three. Perhaps because all or any of these states when manifest where abundantly obvious and not sort of hidden I felt safe. Anyway, who knows about how these things happen and we became good friends at all events.</p>
