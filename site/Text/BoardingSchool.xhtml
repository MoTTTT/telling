  <p>Well those happy days, like any days, happy - or unhappy days for that matter - came to an end; in my case with a bump, because this is where I went to boarding school in Salcombe. For what reason I was taken away from Modbury school, and how they managed to find the where-with-all to send me to a private school, I know not, but to Hazeldene I went. I suppose on reflection that Doc realised that my education was leaving a lot to be desired. There were three of us from Modbury school that ended up at Hazeldene, each as hopelessly behind as the next - Miss White called us dim, stupid, spineless (interesting one that) hopeless and un-teachable, and those are only the names I remember. Miss White was fortunately only a junior teacher. She really, really did look like a monkey by the way. She taught languages and sewing; she was always so disgusted by my efforts at French and German that she could not even find it in her heart to compliment me on my sewing which must have been O.K. I was always a blouse or apron or something ahead of the others and if she didn't like a seam, out it came. Of course I was always ahead with my German, because of having learned it when small, but she didn't appreciate the Viennese part, and would only say I had the most appalling accent she had ever heard! The school was run by Miss Surman - academic department, and Miss Wheatherston - other. It was to Miss Wheatherston that you went to when you thought that you also had caught mumps, which I did in the fullness of time, for the second time. I rather think it was a very good school. I actually started learning to learn there, and began to enjoy the precision of geometry and the way it fell together provided that you knew the things that the previous pages said that you must learn. Miss Surman was marvellous with Shakespeare, History, and Scripture. In English school style they called me Ridgy short for Ridgway. "Yes Ridgy" she said a few times near the end of my time there, "I think you are beginning to get the idea". Unfortunately I didn't get too far with the 'idea' because my people ran out of silver to sell and I left at the tender age or 16. This was a problem for all because I had not taken, nor, as was required by the state, passed, my school leaving certificate. I remember Miss Surman saying that she would simply have to say that I was 'school leaving certificate standard'.</p>

  <p>They were a nice bunch of girls there and in a way I enjoyed it, but I have always been homesick when away from home, and still am up to a point. Our suitcases were kept in an attic and about a week before the end of term came down for packing. I can remember the excitement of that occasion, and similarly I remember ruining the last week or so of my holidays dreading going back. Our generation really appreciates the way teaching has changed throughout the years, and now one of the things that teachers first do, it seems, is see that children enjoy school, and mostly they do.</p>

  <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_14">BACK TO LONDON</h3>

  <p>What to do with Bee-Ann was the next problem that my poor people had to contend with. What they did with her was, send her back to London. All on her own to boot! While living in London previously, Doc was the doctor to the Bradley girls and this is where the next idea for Bee-Ann came from.</p>

  <p>Bradley's was a very exclusive fashion house. It was in Bayswater, on a corner and Chepstow Place led off from it. It was in these Chepstow Place houses that the Bradley girls lived. From having been their official doctor, Doc knew Mr Bradley. He knew that the models and other workers were watched over, and sort of locked up at nights. Those that resided there of course. So off I went to become one of those. I actually worked in the showroom as an assistant to an assistant - literally. Bradley's specialised in fur coats and suits made to order. The customers came in, the suits, coats or whatever modelled for them by the models, and the orders taken with any alterations to the original remarked by the assistant. This information then went up to the cutters who cut and fitted, each of these ladies presided over a large workroom of sewing girls. In the rooms where the fur coats were made, by the way, no talking was allowed, and workers worked for only about 40 minutes without a break, I guess to do with the value of the materials used, only genuine furs in Bradley's. I worked in the 'suits' showroom under Miss Nun, collecting, presenting for inspection, packing to send away, that sort of thing.</p>

  <p>Although I visited Hilde over the weekends, and we did things together, and there were the Nashes, I was, as usual, homesick. The housekeeper in the house that I lived in, which was No 2, owned a large Alsatian dog. My greatest joy was to take Prince for a walk in the park. In those days they used sheep in Hyde Park to keep the grass mown, and Prince and I would go and talk to the shepherd. The girls called me a Bohemian. I had no idea what Bohemian implied in those days, and hoped that it was good. Pauline, who modelled the suits, would go with me to see a film occasionally. Then Bradley's closed down, I swear it was not entirely my doing! I can remember Mr Bradley gathering everyone together to tell them the sad news, the older assistants like Miss Nun, who had been there from the time she left school, cried bitterly. So back to Devon I went.</p>
