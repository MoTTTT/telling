  <h3>DEVON, THE BEGINNING</h3>

    <div class="figcaption">Figure 5: We had smart wooden animal houses, ordered in London, long before any building was started. Here can be seen the duck house. There was also a chicken house, a slightly different shape, plus an A shape one called the Ark - not at all sure who was supposed to live in the ark. Behind my right shoulder can be seen a corrugated iron shed which was for the calves. Later that shed had a lean/to that was the goose shed obviously they didntâ€™ make smart wooden houses for geese.</div>

  <p>The spot in South Devon was a small village 18 miles from Plymouth, 9 miles from Kingsbridge and was called Kingston. The very place in Kingston was a field, a five-acre field owned by a Rogers, I think 'Old Rogers'. There were of course many Rogerses. He didn't at first want to sell his field, but when - I think one hundred - nice new pound notes were laid out on the table, it is said, he changed his mind. It seems reasonable to suppose that the plans were all drawn up in London, but I am not at all sure that that is what happened. I still have one or two of the sketches from the architect. Work commenced, local labour was employed with, I think, Leslie Troupe in charge. Beautiful timber was ordered from Canada. The sewage system was all laid out, the foundations and a couple of chimneystacks built, and the garage built. My mother bought bales and bales of heavy linen for curtains, bedspreads and the like. The months, and a year or two, marched on. So did Hitler!</p>

  <p>Over an intervening period time was spent between the two locations, with a practice to be sold on the one hand and a large house to be built on the other. I was eventually sent to Devon, in Hilde's company part of the time, the rest of that time I stayed with Lesley and Lena Troupe.</p>

  <p>I do not know in what year the whole convalescent home thing drew to a grinding halt, I think probably a few months into the 1940 - 45 war. Materials were simply not available for private building any more, nor ships to transport timber from Canada. Everyone in England believed that the war would very soon be over, so all this was supposed to be a temporary affair only. Lesley went to war, where he died tragically somewhere of appendicitis!</p>

  <p>After, I suppose, a considerable amount of soul searching, the decision was made to move into the completed garage which had two upstairs rooms intended for a housekeeper and groundsman couple. So the base room had an iron stove built into it, as well as a sink, and it was turned into an all purpose living room. A toilet outside. For a bath a metal tub behind a screen was used. Water was pumped by hand from an artesian well, and heated in buckets over Primus stoves. For months this method was also used for all clothes washing, and in those days, my mother reminded me years later, men, doctors certainly, wore starched collars.</p>

  <p>It was a motley crew, our family, that descended on Kingston. There were my mum, and Doc who was a rather small and most unusual doctor, Hilde - this foreign woman with a Germanic accent, and Betty. Betty was Miss Shawbakka she was a little old Jewish lady, and was mentaily deranged. Miss Shawbakka was a patient of Doc's and her family begged him to take her with him to Devon. It was naturally a business deal, and because she provided a certain income my mother rather tended to call her "bread and butter". I remember her only as a small person all in black with white hair in a topknot. She was quite harmless, and spent her days walking from the house to the gate and back. She had done, I believe, some secret service work in the first world war, and spoke many languages. She was German, and 'in extremis' would stand around giving herself up, and saying "they are coming to take me away now, you know, oh yes, they are coming to take me away". I think she must have been with us a year or two before she died. I can remember that during air raids my mother used to shove us under the kitchen table. This being the only place she could imagine as safe should the house receive a direct hit from a bomb being dropped on the way back from Plymouth. This could happen in order to lighten the load of the German bombers on the return flight. This good lady never could understand the rationale behind being shoved under a table in the middle of the night! Miss Shawbakka occupied the second upstairs room. Right, beyond the five above mentioned, there was a canary in a cage, and a Pekinese dog. Added to these was, very soon, a goat. I have no idea at all how the people, dog and canary all fitted into that tiny house, I can only suppose that Hilde and I slept in the downstairs room. Hilde was not there so very long at that stage.</p>

  <p>On understanding Kingston, one must remember that travel was not what it is these days, and besides normal small village tendencies to regard everything that you do not know as strange, or downright bad, as I say, we were a motley crew. South Devon did not go in for goats, so many had not seen one. Certainly Pekinese dogs were not an everyday sight, even a canary was somewhat rare in isolated district places back then. We were regarded as foreigners to the day we left 21 years later. We had Doris from the village working for us in those early days. Hilde insisted that she and any other villagers that she had anything to do with called me Miss Bee-Ann. This fact coloured my relationship with many of my peers and their parents for most of my stay there. The fact that Gabberwell, for this is what we called the house / smailholding, was a little bit out of the village, added to its mystique. The local residents called it the house on the hill. But regardless of the natural suspiciousness of the rural English, we did have two Germans (well, Germans to all intents and purposes) in the household and England had just started a war with Germany. Then there was this devilish creature with a beard prancing around the place. "They say it is a perfectly natural farm animal in some places, but neither my father nor grandfather found such a weird creature necessary", was the generally held opinion.</p>

  <p>We had our ways for finding out what the generally held opinions were. Any visitors from elsewhere that we had, were sent to the local pub and there they would just sit quietly and listen to the local gossip. One conversation - after Doc had treated one of the farmer's cows for some udder complaint with Bonnies Blue, an application much used in those days for fungal infections - went like this. "E in af a funny old doctor that one, e been an painted all of faaarmer Frood's cewws tits blue."</p>

  <p>Other livestock included two calves - Molly and Fanny, Geese, and a lamb with a ribbon around its neck. When the lamb was a baby it was my job to feed it from a bottle, so of course it quite believed that we were bound in an unbreakable relationship - we played well together, and she would come in the house with me time to time. Probably winter then intervened and, come next summer, the time naturally came when my mother left the door open, and next found a full-grown sheep lying resplendent on the sitting room floor. The calves were around growing quietly long before we became resident, and were forever escaping. Doc had to chase and retrieve them when he came down. It is told that he presented quite a picture haring around the lanes in his doctor's pin stripe suits chasing a cow or two. I don't think that anyone in the household was all that used to farm animals actually. Before the cows were mature enough to supply milk, the goat was! What a performance trying to get milk out of that extremely reluctant goat.</p>

  <p>Time came when the 'powers that be' ordered that no one who was not English should live within so many miles of the coast. That of course included Hilde. I don't think anyone bothered much about Betty. So Hilde had to be sent away. I really don't know what was done with these folk, but I think they merely had to live inland. Anyway Hilde, seeing she had fled before Hitler, thought this to be unjust persecution; which in some ways it was. I believe she was just about suicidal, being by this time very fond of our family, although she and Doc fought like cat and dog most of the time. I think they were both jealous of my mother's attention.</p>

  <p>This is where another aspect of Doc comes in, because due to his extra-ordinary influence, he got her into a munitions factory - of all things. And more to come. That was only a stepping stone, for he ended up getting her into the W.A.A.F. in the medical corps. Hilde battled a bit in the air force with her German accent and all - more persecution! But it seems that after a few Christmas concerts where she donned a moustache, pulled her black hair down over her forehead, strutted around raving and shouting in a fair imitation of Hitler, she was more or less accepted by her peers.</p>
