  <h3>EDUCATION</h3>



  <p>I do not suppose that the war can be held entirely responsible for what amounts to my general lack of education, but I guess it had quite a bit to do with it. First I was sent at a very tender age to what Hilde called a kintergarten. This was in Kingsbridge, which was regarded as safer than Gabberwell. There I boarded. The school was called Twyford. There were three other boarders, big girls, probably only about fourteen or so, but I thought they were huge. They did not take kindly to having a six year old in their midst and showed it in many ways. There was, however, a lovely, lovely old lady who was in charge of me. She was loving, giving, ample bosomed, and everything that was comfortable; a gem. This lady taught me to pray. I had never heard of Jesus, the friend that is with one all the time although you can't see him. I thought he was grand and prayed a lot even when I went home, which amused my mum no end. I have no idea how long I boarded there, or why I didn't go on staying there, or if there was a gap between the two but eventually I ended up staying with the Edwards family. He was a dentist in Kingsbridge. I then attended Twyford as a day child.</p>

  <p>There were two Edwards children in the family, Peter and Janet. There was no love lost between us. It was a very proper household with the silver service at every meal. I rather suppose I was found to be a bit of a culture shock. Once a lady came to tea and to make conversation with me asked if I had a cat at home, and I replied that yes I had had but she got pregnant too young, and died of an abortion. Not exactly polite conversation then, if it is now. Also I swore a lot. Doc was a great swearer, so that is where I got the idea probably. Doc always swore in an amusing way. After a row at home once, where my mum obviously thought she needed to protect me, I remember Doc yelling in reply, "She is not a bloody paragon of every bloody virtue, you know'.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly Kingsbridge was not a safe place at all. I have since been told that this could not possibly be true, but I can only tell you what happened. I was probably about eight by this time, the school was at the opposite end of the town to the Edwards home, and I walked to and fro. One day on my way home up the hill there was the terrific noise of very low flying aircraft, and then gun shots clattering around. I don't think there could have been many people around because I have no recollection of people screaming, or running or being hit or anything. I rang a bell and knocked on the nearest door and asked if I could come in to safety, they let me in, and I stayed there until fetched. The result of this little episode was that both Janet and I ended up in Gabberwell. There we both took the opportunity to have mumps or measles, or both. My mom nursed us in their double bed.</p>

Just past the shop behind the short hedge was the post office run from the postmasters private home. The postmistresses garden which ran in a slope up from the road was one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.

  <p>My mother was a very good storyteller, and to keep us entertained during the measles period she told us long stories that had a new episode every day. She would later tell how she was not allowed to polish off any characters, however bad they were, no one was allowed to die; she would eventually end up, she said, feeling quite giddy, in an absolute tangle of all sorts of queer creatures. To this day I can remember an ogre called Uglisome. He, of course, was only ugly on the outside, and all loving kindness within.</p>

  <p>I was one of those kids that get delirious with high temperatures - no Panado syrup for fever back then. My bed would always swim around and my mother had to sit on it to keep it steady! Then there were always lots of little creatures capering around. We - I suspect she - made up poems about them like this one:-</p>
<p>
  <q> When I was in bed with measles,<br/> my room was full of little weasels,<br/> they ran round and round my room <br/> and mummy chased them with a broom,<br/> then they jumped upon my bed,<br/> and all my little spots turned red. </q>
</p>
  <p>Amazing the things you remember.</p>

  <p>Then came the time that I went to the village school - gas mask in hand. It did not go too well with me there, partly because of the "Miss Bee-Ann" business, partly because I spoke differently, lived in the 'house up the hill', and because I had not started there at the same time as the rest. Children being charming creatures, I got myself spat upon and the like. Never in my life have I learned anything as fast as I learned to speak with a broad Devonshire accent.</p>

  <p>We were taught by a Welsh woman. A Miss Durrrel and a member of the Labour Party. In those days much the party of the have-nots. However, she later married a wealthy farmer, her politics changed abruptly and she became a revered member of the Conservative Party. She taught at that school for a long time, and I am sure adequately. You know I can actually remember the time when that good lady was teaching fractions and I thought to myself that that was hard and I was not going to bother to learn that stuff, thus lazy mindedness commenced, and has always been a problem.</p>

  <p>I had one good friend - ginger headed Dina. We had great times together Dina and I. We had a 'faraway tree', and got into many scrapes. We also had this friend, an old lady as mad as they come. She called us her 'little darlings' and we would go and drink dreadful tea with her. She was always in long skirts, and a bonnet. She had piercing black eyes, lots of whiskers, and most of the kids were scared of her. Neither she nor her house smelt too kosher. I remember later, when children from the cities were evacuated to the country and people came to collect some at the official collection point where Doc was involved, she just about had a stand up fight with every one because they wouldn't let her take a couple. Dina and I also did a musical tour of the village with my musical box and a toy piano. At the end of the tour we arrived at my home with quite a considerable amount of remuneration, and my folks said how nice it was of us to do that for the Prince of Wales Hospital in Plymouth; where it was promptly sent! They sent us such a charming thank you letter. Also in mushroom season we would get up early and go and pick mushrooms and sell them. We flatly refused to be parted from that money however, because we said, lots of children did it, which they did. It was quite the thing to know the field where the best mushrooms were to be found.</p>

  <p>Then there was a weird incident. Just out of the village there was sizeable house almost mansion-ish actually, in which lived a tiny little old lady called Miss de la Pole who kept stallions. Anyway she died leaving no relatives and no will. This talk of no will, I suppose, went round and round, and Dina and I read too many children's adventure books, so we went off in search of a will. This of course entailed breaking into the house, which we did and though a thorough search was made no will was found. It was all a bit spooky. Actually we were quite pleased when the search was over and we could get out of the musty house again. Once more back at my home we related all. I can remember that an immediate solution to this problem did not occur to the grownups this time. Anyway eventually my long suffering mother phoned the police and informed them that they had better secure the house a little better, because if two small girls could break in, so could anyone else.</p>

  <p>Then I failed my eleven plus. It has been said in my hearing more than once, that it was practically impossible to fail the eleven plus, but anyway I failed it. It was an important exam because if you passed it you went on to a higher grade school - in Kingsbridge. If you failed it, you went by bus daily to a lower grade school in Modbury, a small town five miles away. Dina also failed, so off we went. I remember very little about what I did or didn't learn there. All I remember is that during the reading periods, unlike everyone else, I actually read. Also our domestic science teacher was called Miss Spellacy and I shone at cooking and sewing. Also I was good at story writing. During composition I had to read my stories to the class more than once. Once I got over being travel sick after the bus journey every day, I was fairly happy there.</p>

  <p>In England in those days there was this milk plan and lunch plan. Every child had to drink a half a pint of milk daily, which was delivered to, and dispensed at, the school. We had to drink it while being watched - not so bad during the Winter, but in Summer invariably sour, so you learned to drink it while holding your breath, then you didn't know the difference. Then every one had a school lunch complete with pudding. If you had a note from your parents' after lunch you could give your note in, and go to town. By which time you were hungry again and would buy, for two pennies, some chips wrapped traditionally in newspaper and consume those on the way back up the hill to school. Sometimes Dina's mother Dora would forge a note for me if I had neglected to get one from home.</p>

  <p>Is it not amazing how the human animal loves to fight. There was an absolute war between those who caught our Bigbury bus, the Thurlston, or Brynston buses or others - you had better not be caught talking to someone who was taken home on one of the another school busses.</p>
