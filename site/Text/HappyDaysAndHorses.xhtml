  <p>By these Modbury school days, the house at Gabberwell as it would finally be, was just about complete. Doc was then sixty-six, which meant that he pulled down one partial house, and built another in his early sixties - small but strong! My mother did a super job making mats and covers for things with that linen that had been bought for the big house. She then worked hard on a veg. Garden which was called 'the kitchen garden!' Gooseberries red and green, Redcurrants, and Blackcurrants, the strong smell of Tomatoes, which we picked and ate like you eat an apple, still reminds me of that veggy garden in Gabberwell. We also had a glasshouse, or greenhouse as it is sometimes called, in which grew cucumbers. When you go into a hot house - another name for it - and pick a cucumber it is often uncomfortably hot and humid in there, and as you put your hand out and pick the cucumber, it will be found to be surprisingly cool to the touch - hence the expression. She also of course had a flower garden. Both were an absolute joy to her. Doc built what he called a' Japanese arch' which was a sort of doorway to a bower housing a garden seat. Bridget left for school round about here. From Doc's medical practice we had quite a few friends by that time locally and in the neighbouring villages.</p>

  <p>From considerably earlier than this we joined in with the harvest efforts, it was just about the end of those everyone-climbs-in days because greater automation was soon to come. I can remember taking large picnic baskets to the fields at lunch time, and the children played while adults got dry hay in and made hayricks. Hilde was around for periods on and off these days, and she, because of her great strength, would compete with the farm boys in the tossing of hay onto the top of the rick, where another would arrange it to make the rick the right shape.</p>

  <p>A lady and her son from just out of the village opened up a local cinema. My mother was delighted, would inspect the poster to judge if it was to be a good film, if she liked the look of it, off we would go. Doc often came if it was likely to be his type. This was an entirely new world to me, and thus was born my love of films. They had a signature tune, did the two that ran this cinema. It was the 'Tritch Tratch polka' and they would play it just before, and as, the lights went down and it added to that feeling of excitement at the prospect of a three hour entertainment where the world as it was simply did not exist. The film was usually accompanied by a running commentary by one of the locals "they be droiving that there o' car dewn the road neew' or " 'e be enjoying that there ol sausage then." Other than this if one wished to see a film or play you had to go to Plymouth. Which of course one did from time to time for shopping and the rest. There was a bus once a week on Thursdays. To Plymouth in the morning and home again at night.</p>

  <p>We had wirelesses for our entertainment, of course. In the early days they had 'wet batteries'. These had to be charged in Modbury, and bringing them home by car was quite an issue because the 'wet' was acid and was quite a problem if it spilt. Then later the normal dry battery kind. There was no T.V. so serials and the like were listened to only. There was 'Dick Barton - Special Agent' Dick had two assistants Snowy and Jock. I sent away for their autographed photographs, the only one that I got back was from the player of Snowy, he did not look a bit as I had imagined and brought me to an understanding of the acting scene with a bump! Then there was 'Children's Hour' where they ran serials like 'Storm of Green Hillocks' - I had beautiful black Alsatian called Storm after the one in that story. During the time that so many children had been evacuated to various places safer than London and the big cities, at the end of 'Children's Hour' they would say "goodbye children" then pause for effect "everywhere" this just about brought my mum, who was particularly fond of children, to tears. I have always since thought that it was rather un-English actually.</p>

  <p>Of these patients of Doc's that became our friends, one family from Ringmore was the Nash family. Mr. had some important lighting job at the Admiralty headquarters in London and the rest were evacuated by the state to the safety of Devon. They lived in Challaborough in a cottage by the sea. There were, Pam, Pat, Michael, David, Wendy, Richard and Christopher, Christopher set himself alight when wearing his flannel and highly flammable pyjamas and just about burnt himself to death. Doc was called in but by the time he got to the child, couldn't save him to any reasonable quality of life, so he died. Mrs was actually in the Journeys End inn down the road when Christopher got hold of the matches but during the inquest Doc perjured himself to protect her. Later when they got back to London there was Nicholas, and Angela. Lots of little Catholics. Mrs Nash was a most extraordinary lady. One of the most unprepossessing looking people I have ever seen, thin as a rake, shocking smokers cough and complexion, eyes badly squint, mousy unkempt hair. But when she opened her mouth and spoke, everyone in a room would turn around and look. She had cultivated, and she told my mother she had cultivated it, the most wonderful and compelling speaking voice I have ever heard. I spent many weekends at the Nash's, running around the beaches and rocks at Challaborough. Wendy had a little bit missing in the top attic and would suddenly and unexpectedly pinch one fiercely - not my favourite person. It is quite extraordinary how people treat 'the state' in England. On arriving back in London after the war Mrs Nash tells how she went to the council office from where they relocated families and merely said "right, here we are, find us accommodation". She lined all her kids up from the biggest to the smallest with the dog at the end, and there she stayed until they found her family somewhere to stay! They had sold a beautiful oak table to Harrods at a very low price in order to get rid of it quickly when they were evacuated. On return to London they were horrified to see the price at which the store was selling it. Mrs. Nash went in and spoke to managers, having things to say about making good out of others misfortunes, but Harrods said that that was how business was run and what businesses did. The price that they were asking was way above her reach. One can imagine her chagrin.</p>

  <p>The other particular friends we had, but this was a bit later, were Monica, Vincent and Johnny de las Casas. Johnny was about five or so years younger than me, so barely tolerated. I used to make him smoke home-made pipes, and rebuked the poor kid fiercely when he coughed and choked. These pipes were made from acorns and straw but I have no idea what we smoked. This we did in the goose shed.</p>

  <p>When we first moved to Devon, super wood houses were bought for all the prospective poultry, there was the ark, two duck houses, and a goose shed. We never got round to using all of these for the purpose for which they were intended, so they made very good storage places. Also hidey holes for me. I remember one becoming my den, and there I read all the 'Mary Plain' books - Mary Plain was a bear.</p>

  <p>If I only tolerated Johnny, I absolutely adored his mother, as did my mother. Her name was Monica and everyone knew her as Monny. She was dark haired, complexioned, and eyed; rather gypsy-like we used to think. She had a husky voice and that rather attractive irresponsibility, topped by a great sense of humour. She was also Catholic, and took me once across the fields to Modbury to the Catholic Church with her. I was most impressed. On the way home we collected mushrooms in her hat.</p>

  <p>My mother had incubators, and hatched chicks and ducklings and on one occasion sold some ducklings to Monny. One was looking a bit sick when she took delivery and my mum having pushed him a bit with her finger, said "this one will be fine in the morning". During a phone call when morning came, when asked how the ducks were, Monny stated that the dead duckling that she had been sold was still dead. This family lived on a farm where Vin, the husband, was trying his hand at farming - I think unsuccessfully. The house was a beautiful glass fronted place overlooking a river, and was called 'Cockleridge'. They had a boat and Monny would take Johnny and I out from time to time. I think Vin was Spanish or something. I was scared of him. I was scared of most men actually and am still uncomfortable in their presence largely. I think this was because Doc was not a particularly 'come hither' sort of person, I had no uncles, cousins, brothers or any male persons round me, so I never got used to men. Monny was still around during my riding days, and we went to a few gymkhanas together. Eventually they went to live in Douglas on the Isle of Man. I saw Monny a few times when I lived in London. She was somehow involved with people who owned a private zoo and trained animals for film work. When they left, they left us Sue and their Budgerigar. Sue was a miniature sheepdog and the cutest little thing you ever did see. The budgie was Pete and talked, boy did he talk.</p>

  <p>I learned to ride on Smokey. Smokey was a very beautiful Arab horse - grey obviously - high-spirited and did not suffer fools kindly. My mother was a great believer in the philosophy that said that when you were thrown from a horse, you got right back on again! Round and round the field we would go with me learning to ride, and Smokey chucking me off at the same corner every, but every, time round until I acquired the ability to stick on, and we came to a sort of understanding. We looked after him for a while for someone else - great loss when he went home. Then Marjorie, Bridget's mother, won a Dartmoor pony. His name was Gypsy. Shetland and Dartmoor ponies were supposed, because they were small, to be good ponies for children to learn on but they were not, being generally wild and bad tempered. I can't remember anyone really riding Gypsy, or what happened to him in the end. Then there was Vicky. He belonged to one of the farmers, and I could borrow him. I rode Vicky for many years.</p>

  <p>During the war cigarettes became hard to come by at times and my mother was a 40-a-day addict. One of my jobs was to take to horse, do the rounds of all the surrounding village inns, collecting cigarettes for her.</p>

  <p>I wonder if the amount of freedom children had in those days and the safety with which they could roam around is a thing of the past. Once I had done my jobs around the house, which included pumping water by hand into the tank at the house - it took about 20 minutes - filling the lamps with paraffin, trimming the wicks as necessary and cleaning the glass chimneys among others, I was free to saddle up any horse I had use of at the time and roam around any of the villages I cared to go to. I had special stopping places around the lanes where I would enjoy a particular view, and the horses got to know where they were and stop there automatically. Then there were always nuts to pick. Hazel nuts are one of the nicest nuts and grow wild in the lanes, in Devon certainly, probably all over England; they grow up high so being on horseback gives one a particular advantage. Down at Wonwell beach in the woods was a super place to roam. As I think of that place I remember the smell of wild Garlic as the horses' hooves bruised the plants. Full of Rhododendrons those woods, quite a picture at the right time of year; then of course a blue picture when the Bluebells were in season. I can recollect collecting arms full of those with Dina.</p>

  <p>Bigbury-on-sea was a favourite one of the villages to ride to. It was the largest and most commercialised of the seaside holiday spots. It had ice cream, and a small amusement arcade with slot machines with little balls dropping into places, if you were lucky - and I always was - the I little balls would drop into the right places and you would come out with considerably more money than you went in with. I actually just about relied on this for my teas and ice creams.</p>

  <p>Just off Bigbury-on-sea there was a tidal island called Borough Island. It housed little more than a large hotel, and a small inn. Once, way back when I was still about five or so, a group of adults went to this island and to the large hotel. I can remember the owner taking an interested group, mostly children, on a tour of the island and showing us all the hiding places in coves and caves where a local pirate, Bill Crocker, used to stash his goods. He was quite famous in those parts. Smuggling goods in, past the customs and excise guys, was still quite fresh in folks' memories in those days. One or two of the rectories had underground passages leading down to the shore.</p>

  <p>When finally the car - I think it was a Morris - packed up, I would ride to Modbury for some of the shopping. I had my own short cut across the fields. In the periods when there was no horse around I rode a bike but I felt safer on a horse, my sense of balance has always been somewhat at fault, and I liked to feel that that which I was riding had a leg firmly placed at each corner. Another horse I rode sometimes was Candy, brown and white and fat and lazy. Never having actually owned a horse I would go to the gymkhanas but never had a horse that was seriously raceable. I must have been about 14 or 15 or so when I rode Star. Often the farmers would lend their hunters out, out of season, to be grazed, exercised, and generally cared for. Star was such a one. I had to go far afield by bike to go fetch him, and can remember being somewhat intimidated when I actually saw him because he was 16hh (hands high). As one hand is 4 inches or 10cm, that makes him 160cm high at shoulder, and that is a lot of horse. I couldn't get on him at all with out the use of a mounting block and as we didn't have a mounting block at Gabberwell a plan had to be made.</p>

  <p>Star only knew one thing and that was that once someone was riding him the thing to do was to gallop off to where-ever, and get it all over and get home as fast as possible and this is what he did, hardly waiting until a person was properly mounted! I remember taking him back in tiptop condition though; he was all shaggy when I first had him but with much grooming he was the most beautiful shining chestnut when I took him back. Amazing the trust that was involved in this kind of arrangement, the farmer had my bike in his stable, and I had his horse.</p>

  <p>I don't quite know how I came to know Ann May but we rode a lot together. Mr May managed a farm. My mother and Mrs May - who never met - would swap tea for sugar during the rationing years, my mom needed the sugar for the making of jams and so on, and the Mays supposedly drank the tea. As I write this Ann is now in her second marriage and judges horses all over Devon. My mum was a great jam maker, a favourite jam in the English countryside is Blackberry and apple jam. We would go picking Blackberries by the hour, Bridget, my mom, the little dog Sue and I. Another thing we picked large amounts of because they grew so prolifically were Primroses, a simple flower that gives its name to a pale yellow, and has the most incredible perfume.</p>

  <p>After the war Hilde settled in London. For a while she had a job as the cashier at a night club called the Coconut Grove. There she had a boyfriend called Sandy who was an Italian. Hilde obviously told him about the folks at Gabberwell and once he phoned to speak to my mum, and on hearing that she loved all the Italian opera songs, promptly sang to her over the phone. Next time Hilde came down he sent with her the entire collection of Gigli records. We had a big square H.M.V. gramophone that you wound up. We loved those records.</p>
