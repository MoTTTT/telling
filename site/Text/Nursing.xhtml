  <p>So, what to do with Bee-Ann again. It was decided that nursing was my only hope, if could get in. People always laugh when they ask what made me decide to go in for nursing, and I say it was a job! 1 can not remember being much involved in any of the decision making with regard to my future, but I suppose I was. I have always been inclined to live from day to day somewhat, and drift; never having goals or aspirations that I can remember. The telling point here with this nursing thing, of course, was, if I could get in, and this turned out to be even more complicated than we all imagined. When you are training as a nurse, you are working for the state. If you work for the state you have to have - "Papers"! My papers as you will remember, were not my strong point, the other thing you had to have was - Education! Another of my weak points. No matter, there was always Doc and his gift of the gab.</p>

  <p>No amount of gabbling though, however gifted, would make up for not having the right - "Papers". This must have caused my folks some anxious moments, because I was now 18, and did not know that I was not Doc's daughter, and I suppose due to the war they had never got round to him sorting out adoption papers. The legalities of adopting a small child are very different from those of adopting an 18-year-old. This had to be done if I was to use the name Ridgway, otherwise goodness only knows what name I would have had, probably Bishop, not a bad name as names go.</p>

  <p>It came as a bit of a shock learning the peculiarities of my birth at the age of 18. Not an age at which one is likely to take that sort of thing kindly and I certainly did not. I remember a poor unfortunate lady, I suppose a social worker, coming and insisting on speaking to me alone. It was a rough ride I gave her, as though it was her fault. Anyway that lot got through OK. Much more difficult was the actual act of getting me registered into the Prince of Wales Hospital as a student nurse. My abysmal lack of education being now a very serious matter. Well, I can only tell you that the amazing Doc bamboozled me in. How I will never know and if it were not me, I don't think I would even believe this awesome fact. I became registered as a student nurse and battled through it all, learning to learn, largely as I went, I think. I never passed any of my hospital exams all the time I was there, but miraculously I did pass both state exams. I can only suppose that the state saw itself as being mighty short of nurses.</p>

  <p>Oddly though, I seem to have remembered most of what I learned, and I think got a good nursing training there. Although I describe myself as not being God's gift to the nursing profession I have never been found lacking exactly. I do not even remember the name of the matron of the time, who had been at the hospital all through the dreadful bombing in Plymouth. The children's ward 'Albertha' was damaged or hit and it was at that time that this lady got an award for bravery. I was, however, always at odds with her, and she must have wondered what had hit her. Not only was I impossible at the exams, but also what they called 'not amenable to discipline'. After a few uncomfortable sessions in her office it dawned on me that if a person worked very hard and scrubbed things very, very clean and was never found to be idle, life generally became more tranquil, so scrub I did. Those were back in the days when the nurses did all the work from sweeping floors and polishing pianos to the inevitable bedpan cleaning. Eventually the day came when I was not the junior nurse and then I learned a very important lesson. I learned that if you are good at it, you can charm your way out of things. The new junior on the ward was very pretty, and when sister asked her if she had scrubbed all the bedpans and she said 'yes', Sister who had obviously inspected them, said 'EVERY ONE nurse' and she smiled prettily and said 'well sister not EVERY one'. Can you believe, sister went off smiling, and she had got away with it. I could never do that, just not the type obviously. The sister tutors' name I do remember. She was called Miss Pasque and I remember her with the greatest possible amount of respect. Lamorna couldn't stand her, funny that.</p>

  <p>I did not enjoy my period of nursing training, but I must say that it improved greatly when Lamorna came and we could not enjoy our nursing training together! Lamorna was a couple of 'sets' after me, which probably meant about six months. She had started her training at St. Thomas's Hospital in London. One couldn't help but notice Lamorna as she was so very different.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>She is one of those people who, a bit like me, looks formidable and is not in the least. I was amazed to find her one-day cleaning her shoes out in the corridor (so that you do not put the carpet in your room at risk) without anyone actually standing over her telling her that she must. So I sat and chatted to her while she did this. Then there is the way she spoke-and walked. She sort of stalked with a measured tread. We are still friends. When living in the environs of the hospital simply became too much for us we got a flat and 'lived out' which was better. When we had any reasonable amount of time off we went to each other's homes. Lamorna's folks had the Dartmoor Inn, which, cold and windswept though it was, her mother managed to make warm and hospitable. Lamorna's father was ex airforce, and very "Gung Ho"! Spoke loudly. Needless to say I was quite unreasonably scared of him. He was Squadron Leader K. P. H. Cleife and either owned or had access to a small aeroplane. One day he took Lamorna and I out in this plane and we circled over Gabberwell doing interesting wing flapping things, and my folks waved white towels. I was unable to appreciate all this as I was far too busy turning green, being sick, and wishing I was dead. I don't think I was regarded as being a very 'good sport'. He wrote several books, airforce etc, types, and later "James Bond gorgeous girlie" types. As I write this he is still going strong at 90, and chasing any girl that seems likely.</p>

  <p>My mum took Lamorna and I on holiday once to Weston-Super-Mare. We had great fun and laughed all the time; my mum was great fun to be with.</p>

  <p>Lamorna had been to a Convent for her education, or part thereof, and though she remained an Anglican, she is about as serious regarding her response to The Lord as anyone I have ever met. I on the other hand, was at another "poof out like a candle" stage of my life, and all this grieved her sorely, poor dear. Some years after I left England we changed addresses once or twice too often and lost touch. Then, when in '95-odd we went to England for the Diocese, I got in contact with her through the Nursing Association and what a joy that was! Lamorna hadn't even known that Andrew was a priest and I a priest's wife with no 'poof in sight.</p>

  <p>The most fearful part of our hospital days was night duty. I don't think anyone who has not done nursing night duty can understand the feverish rush necessary to get the late evening and early morning work done. Then there was always the dread of being put on 'Lopes', the female medical ward with 36 beds usually full of the very sick. As a junior, the horror was of getting the bedpan and washing round done to the clock; as a senior it, was of the diabetics that had come in for stabilising. In the semi-dark of night it is quite hard to estimate if someone was in an insulin coma, a diabetic coma, or merely sleeping peacefully! After facing the music resulting from waking patients to ask if they were all right, I learned to do it by smell! When in my nightmares I am not too busy being chased by Germans, then the day nurses are coming up the stairs and I haven't made the beds and taken the temperatures.</p>

  <p>I went out with a doctor a couple of times while at Greenbank - just to test the waters!</p>

  <p>Although only 18 miles distance separated them (not far by South African standards) the journey from the hospital to Kingston was quite an issue. Getting to Modbury was not too difficult because busses went that way to go on to Kingsbridge. The last five miles had to be by bike. I had a sort of understanding with Stevens' garage about leaving my bike there. On the way back to Plymouth one of the options was to catch the Bigbury bus at Four Cross which because it was just that, four crossing roads surrounded by fields, there was nowhere to leave a bike. This then had to be walked. I suppose it was a good couple of miles. I have a very vivid memory of those walks, usually taken at the last minute at night to catch the last bus.</p>

  <p>Some of my mum's and my favourite books were those written by Jeffery Farnol, especially "The Broad Highway" which my mum read to me before I was really into reading it for myself. - Farnol was particularly good at describing the countryside and walking in it at night, people walked of necessity more in olden days when his books took place. There was inevitably a roughish wind, owls hooting and trees swaying in the moonlight and weather warm or cold, a little on the spooky side. Then one would stand at Four Cross and wait and hope that you had got the thing right and then from the distance would come the brightly lit bus, civilisation at last!</p>

  <p>I hung around doing staff nurse in the South Devon and East Cornwall Hospital, Greenbank Road as it was by then called. Then Lamorna finished her training and after applying to Perth in Scotland to do our midwifery and being accepted we shot up to London to do private nursing.</p>

  <p>Life was a bit easier in Gabberwell by this time. They had an electric pump for the water, which my mom cared for as Doc was by that time a bit past it, a television set, and a better life with me off their hands. I had managed to get my mum to ease him out of doctoring by that time and this was not too easy as the villagers kept coming.</p>

  <p>Wine making was the order of the day with Doc picking the Dandelions and so on and sampling the rather fine wines that mum made. Ivy Willcocks, the postmistress, a very large strong lady who walked many miles with the postbag, made it her business to call at Gabberwell last, and after sampling the latest would happily weave her way down to the gate and home. When I went home I had to try this one or that one because they were not mature yet but 'coming along nicely dear'. Immature wine, even when it is coming along nicely, is not the way to get used to wine and just about put me off for life. Doc used to drink a Whiskey at night and on one occasion it did not get itself ordered, so he had to settle for - some of Pam's stuff. As homemade wine tastes less strong than it is, he drank more than was wise, and just about had to be put to bed!</p>

  <p>My mum and Doc were not too happy to see me go far away to London, but understood that a worker goes where the work is.</p>
