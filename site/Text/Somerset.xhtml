  <h3>SOMERSET</h3>

  <p>A person's story begins with their parents at least, probably much further back than that. In any case my parent's stories are a whole lot more interesting than mine are. Take my mother for instance, if she didn't actually run away to London, she certainly went there as a young lady - too young a lady maybe.</p>

    </div>

    <p>My mother's name was Mable Gertrude, mercifully shortened to Pam, or as her father called her, Mab, as in Mab queen of the fairies, she was told. The family name was Bishop. There were five children all girls but one. Their father ran a successful market garden in Bittern, or Bidden, a small village in Somerset. I only know a few things about my grandfather; he played the violin, called it his 'Strad' short for Stradivarius - which it wasn't of course. His philosophy of life was that you should do unto others as you would they do unto you. He always gave to beggars, and said as doing so "there but for the grace of God go I", and my mother adored him.</p>

    <p>My mother was born about the turn of the century, on the third of March. March it is said in England "comes in like a lion, and goes out like a lamb". It was certainly doing its lion thing on the night of my mother's birth, because Emma said, "ah, she will be a wild one born on a night like this". My mother was quite proud of this, and told me of it many times.</p>

    <p>Emma was, I suppose, a housekeeper, certainly it was with her that the jaunts to the village to buy goods, in the pony trap pulled by Nellie, took place; and she did seem to run the house. She was dearly loved. Children who were naughty at table were banished to the kitchen, there was no punishment in that as the kitchen was always warm and cosy, and besides, Emma was there. Also Kruger the sheepdog-mix was there. He was called Kruger because he was so ugly! All her life my mother did things the way Emma had taught, and referred to her as 'dear old Emma'.</p>

    <p>My mother's mother, now she seemed to be 'something else'. My mother told me in later years that, when I was young, fearful that I was turning out like her mother she watched me most carefully. What she hoped to do about it if her worst fears had been realised she never said! On reflection as an adult though maybe that is where that, "Bee-Ann watch what you are doing" came from. It could be that all people have to be told to watch what they are doing I really do not know, but I do know that I have always been exceeding clumsy. You know droppy, spilly, breaky, that sort of thing. There have been times when I have actually been aware of not having 'watched what I was doing!'</p>

    <p>However this lady who was my grandmother, was deeply religious, a great church lady. My mother suffered from the "church three times every Sunday when I was a child" syndrome, but with this - as usual - went a very thorough knowledge of the Bible. I think my mother herself had quite a problem describing her mother. She seemed to be very vague, and not in touch with reality. My mother told how, if asked where one of her children were, she would say something like "I'm not quite sure dear, but I saw one of the children down by the strawberry patch just now."</p>

    <p>Another time in the early days of the gramophone, a young chap, a friend of one of one of the older girls, asked if he could bring along his newly acquired wonder and demonstrate it.</p>

    <p>Everyone foregathered in the parlour - mostly kept for the visits of the vicar - and the contrivance was produced, it took quite a bit of winding up, and organising, it seems, but eventually a scratching and scraping preliminary sound was heard. My grandmother, much to the dismay of the family said, "oh, is that the noise it makes?" and stalked our without waiting to hear more. She simply didn't quite know what was going on around her most of the time. Hence Emma I guess. My mother when speaking of her would always end up by saying that her husband adored her and that made her fine with my mum.</p>

    <p>For a while my mother's - I think maternal - grandmother lived with them, but by that time she was senile. My mother was one of the few who could manage her. On one occasion the old lady was all dressed up to go out for a walk. As it was either raining or snowing at the time, that walk was most unadvised, so my mum was called and she said "well now Granny, did you have a nice walk, was it raining a bit? Your coat seems damp, can I take it and hang it up and help you off with your other outdoor clothes! It was from this old lady that we inherited the silver tray.</p>

    <p>Of the three other girls in the family I know very little, one was called Edith, but I don't know which one. One was consumptive and later died in a sanatorium. While she was still at home she, being particularly sensitive, my naughty mother and her brother would dress up in sheets and rattle clothes pegs and say "oooo" to frighten her, and one day the poor soul fell down the stairs in her terror. One girl married a preacher, went to Australia and later died in childbirth.</p>

    <p>The third sister must have been married and around England later, because when grandfather's wife died, my grandfather went to live with them, although my mother said he was unhappy there, so she rescued him and he came to live with her in a flat in London. The time when her father was living with her in London, was, I think, a very happy time for my mother. They would go on holiday in France with friends, and so on, until he died of cancer. I think I have a slight memory of him, but I am not sure.</p>

    <p>The only boy in the family was called Walter, and was the apple of everyone's eyes. My mother was apparently a 'tom-boy' and tagged around after him everywhere. I believe she was two years younger than he was, they were the only two dark haired ones, and the others were fair. She proudly tells how when he went off to play with other boys she would be seen 'tagging'. The other boys disapproved of this, but Walter would say, "Oh leave her, she is just like a boy anyway'.</p>

    <p>One of the favourite games was funerals. The deceased were my mother's dolls and the chief and genuine mourner my mum, because in those days dolls were made of a sort of wax, and if my mother didn't dig them up pretty quick the sun would melt their faces! He also kept mice, or anyway one mouse, and its only home seems to have been about Walter's person, peeping out of his pocket or some such. This mouse was named Arabella. One day Arabella got somewhere where she had no right to be. I think making a nest in my mother's bed or something. Anyway, my mum threw her out of the window. When Walter heard about this he regaled my mother with grim stories of what happens to innocent little tame mice when they find themselves among their wild, savage, cousins! Ever after that she was blackmailed with "remember what you did to Arabella".</p>

    <p>Walter was reported missing believed killed during the First World War. The grave of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abby had therefore a very special significance for my mother. My vague grandmother would never believe him killed, and would never even allow the family to have a memorial put up for him in the local church. My mother said she never recovered from the loss of her son.</p>
