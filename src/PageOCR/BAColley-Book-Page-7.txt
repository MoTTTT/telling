About 1938 Doc and household decided on a, retirement to the country, scheme. There
was to be built a very large house somewhere in the country, and it would have many bedrooms,
and be a convalescent home for those recovering from sickness or operation. Doc and Pam set
off on a tour or two of England looking for the most likely spot for their dream.
